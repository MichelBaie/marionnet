Requirements
============
You need several pieces of software to build and use this package; some
of them are only used at build time, while others are needed at runtime.

Please note that for build-time requirements it's essential to also have
the headers/mli files available: if you use the package system of your
distro, this translates into having installed also the "-dev" or "-devel"
packages.


Operating System
================
Marionnet was developed on and for GNU/Linux. We doubt it would be possible
to make UML run on systems with any kernel different from Linux. About the
architecture, again UML is the only limiting factor. Any architecture
supporting UML should be fine.
  Some GNU/Linux-isms may be present. Please write us at
marionnet-dev@marionnet.org if you want to try to port Marionnet to some
other system, we may be able to help.


Build-time requirements
=======================
GNU Make and OCamlBuild are required (as for all our OCaml projects). And
of course you need the OCaml compiler.

[To do: fill this...]


Runtime requirements
====================
[To do: expand this...]
Graphviz (we use dot at runtime)
uml utilities?
bridge utilities?
VDE with our patch.
tunctl
Filesystems.
[X11 with TCP connections enabled]
