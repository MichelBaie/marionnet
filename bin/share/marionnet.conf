# This file can be installed into /etc/marionnet to make a "global"
# site configuration, and each user can override some or all values
# in his/her private ~/.marionnet file.
#
# Each user can also override these settings by defining the same
# variables in the shell environment, before launching Marionnet.

# The name of the Unix socket used to communicate with the Marionnet
# daemon:
MARIONNET_SOCKET_NAME=/tmp/my-marionnet-daemon-socket

# The name of the bridge used for Marionnet (To do: this should change)
MARIONNET_BRIDGE=br0

# The keyboard layout for virtual machines starting in Xnest mode:
MARIONNET_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT=us

# You should leave this set as "false" if you are not developing Marionnet:
MARIONNET_DEBUG=false

# Helper programs used for opening documents in the Énoncé tab:
MARIONNET_PDF_READER=evince
MARIONNET_POSTSCRIPT_READER=evince

MARIONNET_TEXT_EDITOR=emacs

# Optional prefix for vde executables (the prefix may be a path with a trailing
# slash, part of the a file name, or both (with a slash between the path and
# the file name part)):
MARIONNET_VDE_PREFIX=

# It is possible to choose the Terminal used by Marionnet to launch virtual
# host, it is necessary to specify option used to choose title and option
# used to execute a command in the Terminal, separated by comma (by default
# "xterm,-T,-e" is used), you can see examples below or use the "--help"
# switch to know options of your Terminal
#MARIONNET_TERMINAL="xterm,-T,-e"
#MARIONNET_TERMINAL="rxvt,-title,-e"
#MARIONNET_TERMINAL="gnome-terminal,-t,-x"
#MARIONNET_TERMINAL="konsole,-T,-e"

# It is possible to override the installation path, or the directory containing
# UML kernels and UML filesystems defined at compile-time;
# this is particularly useful for packagers or non-root
# users who want to setup Marionnet without writing to system paths.
# Leave this alone if you're not sure whether you need this.

# The router filesystem must have a filename starting with the prefix "router-" and

# Force the Marionnet's temporary working directory.
# Note that this directory must reside on a filesystem supporting sparse files
# (reiserfs, reiser4, ext4, ext4dev, ext3, ext2, udf, ntfs, jfs, ufs, tmpfs,
#  vxfs and xiafs are accepted)
# Note also that Marionnet will choose the first suitable directory in the list:
# $MARIONNET_TMPDIR, $TMPDIR, /tmp, /var/tmp, $PWD, ~/tmp, ~/
#MARIONNET_TMPDIR=/my-non-standard-tmp-directory-supporting-sparse-files

# Disable warnings:
#MARIONNET_DISABLE_WARNING_TEMPORARY_WORKING_DIRECTORY_AUTOMATICALLY_SET=true

# When this flag is "true", all intermediate snapshots are also saved in the
# .mar project, not only the most recent ones. In order to save disk space and
# time leave this flag to "false":
MARIONNET_KEEP_ALL_SNAPSHOTS_WHEN_SAVING=false

# Force the timezone for virtual machines:
#MARIONNET_TIMEZONE=Europe/Paris
