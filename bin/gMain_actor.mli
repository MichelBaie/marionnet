(* Transform the GTK main thread in a actor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)
   --
   All these tools should be called by a "client" thread other than the GTK main thread (gtk_main).
   However, the GTK main thread may call these tools: in this case, they became the standard
   function application (just protected from exceptions). Using the function Thread.id we prevent
   the GTK main thread to remain stucked in a deadlock (waiting for a message from itself).
   ---
   Examples:
     let () = GMain_actor.delegate window#destroy ()
     ---
     let y = GMain_actor.apply (fun x -> x*2) (21) in
     Log.printf1 "Created thread: testing a call to the GTK main thread: result is %d\n" (Either.find_right y |> Option.extract);
   ---

   the caller doesn't wait for the result; it just gives the "order" of
