"In this dialog window you can define the name of an Ethernet socket and set "
"parameters for it. This component allows the user to connect the virtual "
"network to a Linux bridge whose name is defined by the user via the "
"configuration variable called MARIONNET_BRIDGE (in marionnet.conf or provide "
"on the command line).\n"
"\n"
"If the bridge is correctly set on the host (before starting the network), "
"virtual machines will be able to access to the same network services (DHCP, "
"DNS, NFS, ...) that the host can access on its local network; if the host is "
"on the Internet then also the virtual machines linked to the socket will "
"be.\n"
" \n"
" To create a bridge on your (real) host using the same network as eth0 (by "
"example) you need to : 1) create a bridge with the name define in "
"marionnet.conf by MARIONNET_BRIDGE, 2) put and configure eth0 (on your real "
"host) in the bridge and 3) put an IP address on the bridge (with dhclient or "
"ifconfig/route).\n"
"\n"
"In such a case, after having start the virtual network in marionnet you can "
"configure an ethernet card of a virtual machines which is connect to the "
"Ethernet socket (or on the same network) in order to give access to your "
"local network to it.\n"
"\n"
" The socket also allows team-work in a network laboratory, by creating a "
"connection between Marionnet instances running on different machines. For "
"more information about bridge et Ethernet socket configuration, please see "
"the Marionnet Wiki on the marionnet.org website."
