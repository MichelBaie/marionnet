                          below; see sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the
                          negated scheduling priority, minus one; that is, a
                          number in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to
                          real-time priorities 1 to 99.  For processes
                          running under a non-real-time scheduling policy,
                          this is the raw nice value (setpriority(2)) as
                          represented in the kernel.  The kernel stores nice
                          values as numbers in the range 0 (high) to 39
                          (low), corresponding to the user-visible nice
                          range of -20 to 19.
                          Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
                          the scheduler weighting given to this process. *)

                          expressed in jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value
                          is expressed in clock ticks (divide by

   Wait until something happen (by default a `close_write' event) in a directory.
   Implemented as passive waiting based on Inotify.
   This function never raises exceptions except Invalid_argument at starting if the provided directory
   does not exist. The function simply returns when the directory does not exist anymore or when the
   optional argument ?exit_door is set up and the provided filename is written.
