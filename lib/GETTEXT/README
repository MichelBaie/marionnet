This is a very simple OCaml wrapper for GNU Gettext, allowing for
internationalization of messages in OCaml programs.

Date, time and more advanced features like plurals are *not* currently
supported.

The interface is extremely simple: it suffices to initialize gettext
support at startup time by calling initialize_gettext, which takes
two parameters: the text domain, and the locale directory.

After that, strings can be translated by simply calling gettext, taking
an English string and returning a translated string. gettext is thread-safe
and can be called without any external synchronization.

gettext has an alias with a shorter name, s_. You can use f_ for format
strings to be passed to Printf.printf and friends.

An example is included: see gettext_example.ml.


The Gettext ocaml wrapper is free software; it's released under the GPL
version 2 or, at your option, any later version released by the Free
Software Foundation.
