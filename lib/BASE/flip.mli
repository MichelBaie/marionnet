(** Little trick allowing to write the first functional argument
    of a 2nd order function, at the end of the syntactic construction.
    The name `flip' is justified by considering the curryfied version
    of the argument, even for flip2 and flip3.
    For instance, considering:

      (1)  List.map2 : ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a list -> 'b list -> 'c list

    as it was (curryfying after the functional argument):

      (2)  List.map2 : ('a -> 'b -> 'c) * ('a list * 'b list) -> 'c list

    we have:

      (3)  (Flip.flip2) (List.map2) : 'a list -> 'b list -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c list

    as it was (curryfying):

      (4)  (Flip.flip2) (List.map2) : ('a list * 'b list) * ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c list

    So, modulo curryfication, (4) is the flipped version of (2) and (3) is the flipped
    version of (1).

(* Examples:

        (* A lot of long and useful code here *)
        x+1) ;;
    - : int list = [1; 3; 5]

    (Flip.flip) (List.filter) [0; 2; 4] (fun x ->
        (* A lot of long and useful code here *)
        x mod 4 = 0) ;;
    - : int list = [0; 4]


    (Flip.flip2) (List.map2) [0; 2; 4] [1; 3; 5] (fun x y ->
        (* A lot of long and useful code here *)
        x+y) ;;
    - : int list = [1; 5; 9]
