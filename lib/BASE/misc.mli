(* Protect an action from any kind of exception: *)

val protect2 : ('a -> 'b -> unit) -> ('a -> 'b -> unit)
val protect3 : ('a -> 'b -> 'c -> unit) -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c -> unit)

(* Apply a function and detect if it returns an ordinary result without raising any exception: *)
val succeed  : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> bool
val succeed2 : ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a -> 'b -> bool

(* Print immediately a message on stderr. For debugging purposes: *)
val pr : ('a, out_channel, unit, unit) format4 -> 'a

(* Note that ~finally is itself protected by exceptions and its result is ignored.
   If the applied function raises an exception, this exception is re-raised after finalization: *)
val try_finalize  : finally:('a -> (exn, 'b) Either.t -> 'ignored) -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
val try_finalize2 : finally:('a -> 'b -> (exn, 'c) Either.t -> 'ignored) -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a -> 'b -> 'c

(* Get the unique identifier of a Caml value representation.

(* Trace calls of a function (entering/exiting).
   Example of usage:
   ---
