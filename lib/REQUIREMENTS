Requirements
============

You need several pieces of software to build and use this package; some
of them are only used at build time, while others are needed at runtime.

Please note that for build-time requirements it's essential to also have
the headers/mli files available: if you use the package system of your
distro, this translates into having installed also the "-dev" or "-devel"
packages.


Build-time requirements
=======================
GNU Make and OCamlBuild are required (as for all our OCaml projects). And
of course you need the OCaml compiler.
