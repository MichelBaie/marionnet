Thanks
======

We are deeply grateful to other free software projects for many
good-quality components we have reused, helping to make Marionnet what
it is now and to make it a pleasure to develop for us; Marionnet is
part of our contribution, still unworthy, back to the community. 

We wish to thank Jeff Dike for User Mode Linux (UML), Renzo Davoli for
Virtual Distributed Ethernet (VDE), the authors of OCaml and of course
the whole free software community, whose foremost contributors remain
the GNU and Linux projects. 

Davide Vaghetti taught us to set up Quagga-based virtual
routers. Thierry Hamon helped debugging an early prototype and gave us
useful suggestions. Joseph Cerrato, Christophe Fouqueré and Christian
Lafont encouraged us when we needed it and solved many otherwise
unsolvable administrative problems. 

Silviu Barsanu designed our beautiful logo; Perfect produced icons for
Marionnet, covers and desktop wallpapers for the DVD. 

Jonathan Roudiere is doing a great work on making debian packages, and
is the installer and main administrator of the server www.marionnet.org.

Université Paris 13 sustained us while we were working on Marionnet by
financing it as an e-learning project. Further support was provided by
the IUT of Villetaneuse and Institut Galilée. LIPN provided us with
computing devices, Internet connection, and a very enjoyable
environment where to live and work.
