	  Hide or show ethernet interfaces. This utility allows the user
	  to take advantages of the system calls introduced by the
	  Marionnet's developers in order to "ghostify" (or "unghostify")
	  ethernet interfaces. This feature is used in Marionnet for
	  pedagogical reasons in order to hide the interface eth42
	  and the related X11 traffic.
