Kernel code error :
===================

Part  of  the kernel  which  has in charge the Ghost operations can
return several error code when an error occurs.

Ghostify or Unghostify a network interface (card) is done through a
ioctl(2) request, on error  ioctl  request use errno to provide the 
number of the error.

The differents error code which can be returned are :
-----------------------------------------------------

During Ghostify operation :
---------------------------

EINVAL - This error is returned  when the name of the specified
	 network  card is too long (greater than IFNAMSIZ) or  when
	 the name has a null length. This error is also returned by
	 a incorrect ioctl() request. With ghost2 this reflects the
	 fact that the kernel doesn't supports the Ghost operations
     (because the other cases are handled by the program).

EEXIST - This error occurs when the network card is already ghostified.

ENODEV - This error is returned when the specified network card
	 doesn't exist (really doesn't exist ;).

ENOMEM - This error is returned when the max number of ghostified
	 network cards has been reached.

During Unghostify operation :
-----------------------------

ENODEV - This error is returned when the specified network card 
	 doesn't exist (really doesn't exist ;).

ESRCH - The network card is not ghositified.
