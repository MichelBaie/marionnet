Notes about the compilation of the series 3.0.%
-----------------------------------------------

The execution of the script "pupisto.kernel.sh 3.0.84" produces a linking error:

  arch/x86/include/asm/atomic64_32.h:72: undefined reference to `atomic64_set_386'

similar to the errors fixed by the patches:

 linux-3.?.%.compile_with_ARCH_um_SUBARCH_i386.diff

for the successive kernel series (3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8). 
There is probably a work-around for this problem by changing some configuration options.
Actually, if we generate the .config file with the function: 

 create_kernel_config_from CONFIG-3.0.8

the compilation of 3.0.8 succeed (but 3.0.84 fails). 
However, we are not currently able to adapt the patch for the series 3.2 to the serie 3.0, 
neither find the .config options to fix.
