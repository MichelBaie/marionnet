About files `binary_list*'
------------------------
The files `binary_list.machine-*.*' have been generated launching in Marionnet
the corresponding virtual machine, then executing (as root) the following
bash function:

function binary_list {
 local i DIRS
 DIRS=$(for i in ${PATH//:/ }; do [[ -d $i ]] && echo $i; done)
 find $DIRS -perm -u=x ! -type d ! -name "*[.]so*" -exec basename {} \; | sort | tr '\n' ' '
}

About file `package_catalog.{wheezy,squeeze}.GENERATED'
-------------------------------------------------------
Note that the generation of files `package_catalog.{wheezy,squeeze}.GENERATED'
takes about 1 hour in a system with a good internet connection.

About files `package_catalog.{wheezy,squeeze}.selection'
--------------------------------------
The file `package_catalog.$RELEASE.selection' is the unique relevant source of
informations for the script `pupisto.debian.sh'. Uncommented lines specify
the packages that we want to include in the generated debian filesystem.
If you rebuild the file `package_catalog.$RELEASE.GENERATED' (make $RELEASE),
you have to manually merge it with `package_catalog.$RELEASE.selection'.
For instance, if you have the tool `kdiff3' installed, you can proceed as follows:
(I suppose here RELEASE="wheezy")

$ make package_catalog.wheezy.COMPLETE.COMMENTED.selection

$ kdiff3 -m -o /tmp/merging  package_catalog.wheezy.{selection,COMPLETE.COMMENTED.selection}
  (resolve conflicts selecting B)

# UPDATE!
$ cat /tmp/merging > package_catalog.wheezy.selection
