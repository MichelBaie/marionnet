These directories contain UML kernel patches (mostly for
ghostification), kernel .config files, and userland utilities 
(again, mostly for ghostification).

Our repositories do *not* contain copies of Linux, since the kernel
is huge and we only need tiny modifications.

All of this makes easy to create UML kernels usable with Marionnet.
This part of the work has been performed by Jonathan Roudiere and Luca
Saiu.

These directories contain a set of scripts to build kernels and/or 
filesystems (Buildroot and Debian) suitable for Marionnet. 
This part of the work has been performed by Jean-Vincent Loddo with 
the contribution of Antoine Seignard.
